# Color Vision Deficiency

The terms Color Blindness, and Color Vision Deficiency (CVD), focus on what people can't do.
This is important, but I have reservations about pathologizing all difference.

It is possible to create variations of the standard color blindness test that demonstrate that inherited color blindness allows people to see differences which normal vision is unable to detect.

Consider this finding published by Sussex Research,
"In the natural world it is possible that the minority phenotype has been able to spot predators or food sources that are less visible to the majority phenotype. Analogues of both normal and anomalous forms of human vision are found... Regan et al have calculated that some fruits in the Cebus diet are more visible against foliage to the deuteranomalous phenotype and other fruits more visible to the protanomalous phenotype, with the 'normal' phenotype being intermediate."

That is to say, there is a fruit gathering monkey with similar "color blindness" to ours, who has an advantage when searching for certain types of fruit over normal sighted monkeys.

While it is interesting to consider the vestigial advantages of genetic diversity, or even contemporary advantages (such as detecting camouflage), our primary focus will be on accessibility.
From here on I will be concerned with what "differently abled" vision can't do.

## Causes

The primary cause of CVDs is genetic inheritance, but it can also be caused by damage to the eye, the optic nerve, or parts of the brain.
Some medications disrupt normal color vision, as well.

The retina contains three different types of cones tuned to perceive long, middle, or short wavelengths.

These "L-", "M-", and "S-" cones correspond roughly to the Redish, Greenish, and Bluish color ranges.

## Variation

From these three inputs a person with normal color vision can distinguish more than 100 "hues".
For example, green and brown are different hues, pastel green and dark green are of the same hue.

There are 7 or 8 types of CVD split into three basic catagories:
- Red-green
- Blue-yellow
- Complete Color Blindness

### Red-green

> Common in males, rare in females.

Red-green CVDs are nearly 1000x more common than blue-yellow ones. 
This is because inherited disorders disproportionately affect the L-cones or the M-cones.

Congenital red–green color blindness are caused by anomalies in the X chromosome.
Women must have defects in both chromosomes before they exhibit this colorblindness.
As a consequence it affects 1/12th the male population, but only 1 out of 230 women.

It is more common in Caucasians than other ethnic groups, and the role of genes in colorblindness is not yet fully understood.

#### Confusion Colors

- Cyan and Grey
- Rose-Pink and Grey
- Blue and Purple
- Yellow and Neon Green
- Red, Green, Orange, Brown

#### Types

There are 4 types of red-green color blindness.
Protans L-cone (red) weak, while Deutans are M-cone (green) weak.

1. **Protanomaly** the L-cone is more like the M-cone, so red looks less bright shifts into green.
2. **Deutanomaly** makes the M-cone more like the L-cone, making green look more like red. 

These usually doesn’t get in the way of normal activities.

People with 3. **Protanopia** and 4. **Deuteranopia** are unable to tell the difference between red and green.

### Blue-yellow

> Less common, found equally in men and women.

#### Confusion Colors

- Yellow and Grey
- Blue and Green
- Dark Blue/Violet and Black
- Violet and Yellow-Green
- Red and Rose-Pink

#### Types

There are 2 types of blue-yellow color blindness:

1. **Tritanomaly** makes it hard to tell the difference between the above confusion colors.
2. **Tritanopia** indicates no ability to differentiate them.

It also makes colors look less bright.

### Complete Color Blindness

> Rare.

There are 2 types of total color blindness.

1. **Achromatopsia** (Rod Monochromacy) has been known to medicine since at least 1777.
2. **Blue Cone Monochromacy** identified in the 1960s when genetic considerations led researchers to distinguish it from Achromatopsia.


## Testing and Remediation

Since 1875 printed dots of different chromaticity to produce patterns have been used to test color vision.
The Ishihara color test was developed in 1917 and is now the standard.
These prints must be properly calibrated for accurate evaluation.

Designers should follow guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), in order to ensure that products are accessible to everyone.

Processing color images to add texture or shift colors can be useful in some cases, but the most common consideration is to ensure that contrast ratios allow for differentiation regardless of color use.

It is always important that color is not the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. 


## Other Animals

Some birds, fish, and insects possess sophisticated color visual systems with capabilities beyond humans.
While it is far from my objective with this video it is interesting to think about.
While primates have 3 color cells that detect "the visible spectrum", some birds have 4 or 5 color cells with vision into the infrared and ultraviolet ranges.
